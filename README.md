### About the Game

- All sprites are AI-generated (school project with no access to artists).
- The game currently features a simple, easy-to-follow combat system based on cards and mana management.
- You can play through 4 regular battles and 1 miniboss battle.
- After each fight victory, you are presented with a choice of 3 doors.  
  The code for dynamically changing what the doors lead to is already in place, but the other options are currently commented out due to time constraints.
- Relics and different cards are implemented as data entities but currently cannot be collected or used in gameplay.
